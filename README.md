Super Bowl squares is a common office pool or party game, and it is easy to play. It’s a game of chance and each player draws two “numbers” but it can make the Super Bowl experience more rewarding if your favorite team isn’t playing. Here is how it works:

-   The game starts with a 10-by-10 grid or 100 individual boxes — each of which is assigned a universal price tag, like $1 per square.
-   Before the Super Bowl kicks off, participants purchase individual boxes — generally as many as they wish — until all 100 of them are accounted for.
-   The numbers 0-9 are then assigned to the columns and rows (usually at random), giving two numbers to each individual cell.
-   The game can be played in a few different ways. Typically, one axis represents the last digit of the NFC team’s score and the other represents the last digit of the AFC team’s score. Whoever has the correct digits of the final score wins the pot; If the Rams win 28-21, for example, the winning square would be where the No. 8 on the NFC axis meets the No. 1 on the AFC axis.
-   Most Super Bowl squares pools give a prize at the end of the first quarter, second quarter, third quarter and the final score. One of the most popular variations on Super Bowl squares is to pay out 25% of the pot at the end of every quarter, rather than all of it at the end of the game. (Or, in some cases, 20% at the end of the first and third quarters, and 30% at the end of each half). This makes it more likely that there will be multiple winners, albeit with smaller shares of the pot.
-   The values on each axis are usually assigned at random, so you might not have a choice here. But if you do, your best bet will generally be some combination of zeroes and/or sevens. In a 2013 blog post, the Harvard Sports Analysis Collective wrote that the single best square to have is seven on the favorite’s axis (the Rams are the favorites this year) and zero on the underdog’s, with the 0-0 square a close second.
